# Supabase Database Schema Fixes

## v2.0.1 - Exercise 5 Set 4 Columns Missing

**Date:** October 16, 2025

**Problem:**
App was trying to save Exercise 5 Set 4 data (reps/weight) but database tables were missing those columns, causing error:
```
Could not find exercise_5_set4_reps column of week1_day3_workout_tracking in the schema cache
```

**Solution:**
Added missing columns to affected tables.

### SQL Commands Executed:

```sql
-- Week 1 Day 2
ALTER TABLE week1_day2_workout_tracking
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS exercise_5_set4_reps INTEGER,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS exercise_5_set4_weight NUMERIC(5,2);

-- Week 1 Day 3
ALTER TABLE week1_day3_workout_tracking
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS exercise_5_set4_reps INTEGER,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS exercise_5_set4_weight NUMERIC(5,2);
```

### Testing:
- ✅ Week 1 Day 2 workout logging works
- ✅ Week 1 Day 3 workout logging works
- ✅ Client email logging confirmed working

---

## Future Schema Audits Needed

**Tables to check for consistency:**
- week1_day1_workout_tracking ✅ (verified has all columns)
- week1_day2_workout_tracking ✅ (fixed)
- week1_day3_workout_tracking ✅ (fixed)
- All Week 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 tables (not yet verified)

**Recommendation:** Run a schema audit script to verify all week/day tables have identical column structures for exercises that should have the same number of sets.
