## üêõ KNOWN ISSUES

### Issue 1: EAS Updates Not Applying to v2.4.0 Build

### Issue 2: X Button Not Working in Custom Workout Builder
**Status:** IN PROGRESS (testing v2.4.1 build)
**Attempted Fixes:**
1. ‚ùå Modal approach - worked but too slow, menu button hidden
2. ‚ùå Navigation with `navHook.goBack()` - didn't work
3. ‚è≥ Navigation with `navigation.goBack()` + fallback - testing in v2.4.1
